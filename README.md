## Description 

In this application you will be able to view create and track daily workouts.  This will also allow you to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of a particular resistance exercise and the distance traveled for a cardio exercise.  For this application I created a mongo database using a mongoose schema and the routes are handled by express.  Here is the link to the [application](https://...........).

## UserStory

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
